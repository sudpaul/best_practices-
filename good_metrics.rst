So what makes a good metric?

A good metric should have the following characteristics
#########################################################

Accurate
**********************
It should go without saying that metrics should be accurate. If the estimation of the impact of the property couldn't properly measure 
then that concept can't be adequately measured. As such it shouldn't be a metric.
 
Simple and intelligible
*************************
Metrics are meant to be read and understood at a glance. Metrics are often presented in the context of a dashboard/report containing other metrics. 
There is much to read and understand, so it should be easy to read each of the dashboard's/report's components. Think of metrics as the headline to a story.
Because metrics are often divulged to broad audiences, they should be targeted to a common denominator.

Easy to drill down into
***************************
Metrics are meant to monitor how a business is doing. Sometimes they will reveal that something is going exceptionally well, or exceptionally bad. 
In either case we will be interested in knowing what factors contributed to the change in the metric. In other words, metrics are headlines, you need 
to be able to read the story. Since metrics typically are comprised of components (for example, profits can be seen has having two components: revenue 
and costs), we need to be able to drill down into them to understand what the change is attributed to.

Actionable
********************
The point of measuring the health of the business is not just so we know if things are going well or not. The goal is to act on things if they're not going in 
the direction we want. For this reason, a good metric needs to be actionable.For example, it's known that weather has an impact on sales in brick-and-mortar stores, 
but we can't change the weather. A better option — and one we can act on — would be to measure the relevancy of our products based on the weather.

Dynamic
*****************
Metrics need to be dynamic, they need to change over time. This characteristic is somewhat related to the above, but merits some distinction.
Many companies rent their offices instead of buying them. How much companies pay on leases is something that can potentially be acted on, in this sense it is actionable. 
However, since leases are legal contracts with relatively extended periods of time, this metric shouldn't be tracked — it's not dynamic enough.

Standardized
*******************
The broader the reach of a metric (in terms of its audience), the more the metric's elementary components need to be standardized, so that everyone sees the same thing.
Not doing this causes inconsistency and misinformation, potentially resulting in unwanted outcomes.

To give a couple of examples:

Should Amazon count a sale as such the moment the customer places the order? When the payment goes through? When the order leaves the warehouse? When it is delivered? Even something as simple as the concept of sale can be ambiguous.

In supply chain management, lead time is defined as "the amount of time that passes from the start of a process until its conclusion."

Piggybacking from the previous example, should the lead time go up to the point where the order leaves the warehouse or until the customer receives it? Given that Amazon outsources the deliveries to companies like UPS, they don't have much control over what happens once the order is "on the road." However, from a customer satisfaction perspective, how long a customer takes to receive the order is definitely very relevant.

Conflicting definitions should be resolved when a metric is monitored by many people in the company.

Business oriented
************************
A metric should be relevant for the business. Here at Dataquest, we could potentially track how many times students use the character a in their answers. 
But it's unlikely to have any impact on how well they learn.Metrics need to be adjusted to the current needs of the business.

Take, for instance, Netflix. They possibly tracked how much business they were losing to piracy. When streaming became easily available and relatively cheap, piracy stopped being a serious issue and there (possibly) was no need to track it anymore.
