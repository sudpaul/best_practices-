# About

A set of python scripts that anyone can use on a frequent basis to make  work more effective. 
However, the number of python scripts grow with time it becomes diffcult to manage. 
This repo is implementation of some best practices to manage  python code base so that code base can sustain and maintain it over the years. 

## General guidlines

These scripts will mostly be used to solve realtively small to medium sized data problems. 
The data is typically hard to manipulate in Excel other industry closed source software but does not require dedicated hardware.
The code may be one off or used as part of a periodic reporting/analysis project.
The code is used to solve internal problems and is not meant to be used as part of a large scale projects
The code base tends to include a lot of standalone scripts without many multi-file python apps.
Most files contain between 20-300 lines of python code.
You are the sole developer or only a very small group of people use the code in question.
There are no broader department/company wide procedures in place  that cover your code.
